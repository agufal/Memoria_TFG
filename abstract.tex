{\bf \Huge Abstract}

  \end{center}
\vspace{1cm}

This project consists in presenting the design and implementation of a specific device which allows for registering accelerometry data obtained from a route made by a cyclist, for measuring the effort that he/she experiences. This device will be fixed to the handlebar or the seatpost of a mountain bicycle and it will be complemented by information that is provided by the mobile phone's GPS.

The data registered by the sensor will be sent to the mobile phone using Bluetooth Low Energy, whose functioning is also explained in this memory project.
